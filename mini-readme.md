# VoidCompass // UPDATE LOG

## v5.4.2.6 // Python Runtime, Planet Materials & Carrier Travel
**Release Date:** 2026-Sep-08

* Removed the Tk backend, hidden widgets and native Canvas renderers. A Python event loop now owns startup, scheduling, journal dispatch, profile state and shutdown; the HTML command deck, Atlas and overlays receive models directly from the application. WebView2 owns the visible windows, file dialogs and overlay input policy; clipboard access uses Windows directly. Packaged builds exclude Tk.
* Fixed cold-start HUD activation, including Navigation, and startup visibility restoration for Survey Operations and Contact Scope. Verified all 11 overlay windows with representative content.
* Added Planet materials under Explore & survey, showing scanned raw-material percentages and DSS mining-location counts alongside editable surface mining sites.
* Use current coordinates fills the current system, planet, latitude (Y) and longitude (X), including zero and negative coordinates. Live coordinates remain available while editing; unavailable planetary coordinates disable capture.
* Added a populated mining-material selector, including all 13 new Rhino commodities in Frontier's 4.4.1.0 notes. Additional materials can be entered manually. Catalogue entries are choices; saved site contents record commander observations, while normal raw percentages retain their journal evidence.
* Mining sites use a separate commander-profile SQLite database, included in profile backups. Add, edit, delete and search sites across planets; stale-profile commands and invalid coordinates are rejected.
* Carrier preparation and lockdown now show the countdown to journal DepartureTime for the personal or Squadron Carrier actually being ridden. The navigation states apply only while docked or on foot aboard a carrier and clear on departure or cancellation.
* Lockdown uses the final 3m20s of the scheduled countdown; the journal does not emit a separate physical-lockdown event.
* CarrierJump confirms arrival. A matching CarrierLocation during an already-observed transit also confirms arrival, covering journals that write it first. Transit waits for journal confirmation; the confirmed arrival remains readable for 12 seconds before returning to the ordinary onboard state.

## Earlier releases

* **v5.4.2.5** — Improved Navigation route hierarchy, next-system and distance labels, expanded survey/discovery rows, brief attention highlights and Survey Operations window sizing.
*   **v5.4.2.4** — Rebuilt navigation state animations with holographic instruments and a layered asteroid field, improved animation pacing, refined carrier readability, and separated personal/Squadron Carrier tracking, routes and Discord transitions.
*   **v5.4.2.3** — Added Rhino mining haul/processing accounting, Planetary Resource Intelligence, barycentre-aware Orrery records, Field Discoveries and vehicle ledgers; tightened Mining Command layout and corrected cargo-hold recovery after returning from an SRV.
*   **v5.4.2.2.1** — Corrected surface-control HUD states so handbrake, turret and drive-assist animations retain the active Rhino, Nomad, Scarab or Scorpion artwork instead of falling back to the mothership portrait.
*   **v5.4.2.2** — Made Cargo Manifest vessel-aware with the Rhino's 72-tonne hold, correct active-vehicle telemetry, profile persistence and clean hold-switch animations.
*   **v5.4.2.1** — Rebuilt the Live System Orrery as a full-width interactive Elite-inspired instrument with journal-accurate orbital architecture, known-system recovery, branch-aware scaling and lightweight profile-aware controls.
*   **v5.4.2** — Added first-class Rhino journal and vehicle-state support, planetary mining-location DSS evidence and retained survey presentation, with Rhino mining and SRV cargo flowing through the existing unified pipelines.
*   **v5.4.1.9** — Rebuilt Mining Command around one journal reducer with target directives, readiness, prospect/refinery yield, objectives, analytics, ring intelligence and buyer lookup; simplified Prospector Analysis and enforced HTML-only overlay presentation.
*   **v5.4.1.8** — Added overlay recovery, Screenshot Chronicle, Exploration Preflight and Smart Next Action; hardened first-launch overlay restoration and station/carrier vicinity state.
*   **v5.4.1.7** — Added Deep Space Contact Scope, FSD-injection and station/carrier awareness, DSS efficiency receipts, animated Cargo and Survey Operations, and profile-aware contact auto-hide.
*   **v5.4.1.6** — Expanded authoritative Navigation states, docking guidance, cockpit modifiers, repair/reboot responses and heat, suit and jet-cone hazards.
*   **v5.4.1.5** — Rebuilt the Navigation System Survey as a discovery-driven angular rail, rebuilt the HTML bootloader and Galnet intelligence reader, and hardened dashboard/overlay update recovery.
*   **v5.4.1.4** — Added the persistent Galnet Relay and in-app archive, official RSS caching and profile-aware controls; repaired complex panel arranging and clarified Navigation waypoint destination, progress and distance.
*   **v5.4.1.3** — Unified theme-aware Dashboard controls and profile panel arranging, rebuilt the System Workboard and waypoint rail, completed semantic Station, Cargo, Carrier, Prospector and Heartbeat overlays, refined vehicle handoffs and added neutron-tier flight animation.
*   **v5.4.1.2** — Added the Explorer Decision Deck, six exploration doctrines, five-jump Route Horizon, Session Pulse, Regional Codex Hunt, profile-aware briefing-card layouts and optional automatic profile safety snapshots.
*   **v5.4.1.1** — Refined Navigation arrival, planetary flight, landing gear, FSD cooldown, map/scanner and side-panel states; simplified vehicle departures and retired the redundant System Intelligence overlay.
*   **v5.4.1** — Stabilised HTML overlay transparency and profile-aware opacity across hide/show cycles, and corrected the Galactic Atlas Focus Map viewport so every WebGL and overlay layer stays clipped and aligned.
*   **v5.4.0** — Added Stellar Cartography with the live System Orrery, Exploration Survey Queue, Planetary Field Map, Expedition Replay, Explorer Science Lab and 42-region Galactic Passport; refined Navigation's vehicle and exploration states, added Survey Operations landability markers and repaired the initial Focus Map layout.
*   **v5.3.9.3** — Completed the visible HTML overlay conversion, rebuilt Overlay Studio dragging, refined Navigation flight effects, retired obsolete speech/career/Tk code, restored Planet Waypoint lifecycle and repaired HTML hotkey recording.
*   **v5.3.9.2** — Converted cockpit notifications and achievement unlocks to semantic HTML, prevented empty Survey Operations startup flashes and restored its planet-side focus lifecycle.
*   **v5.3.9.1** — Rebuilt the Navigation State Spine with a complete ship/vehicle identity catalogue, state-specific 30 FPS motion, readable biological workboards and restart-safe surface context.
