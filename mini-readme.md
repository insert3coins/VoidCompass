# VoidCompass // UPDATE LOG

## v2.1.6 // Route Plotter Update
**Release Date:** 2026-Feb-16
*   **Dashboard Redesign (same color theme):**
    *   Added top summary strip for `SYS`, `ROUTE`, `SCAN`, `TRAFFIC`, and `SESSION`.
    *   Added alert bar with live system-state indicators.
    *   Added operations card grid, details drawer, and filtered activity log.
*   **Route Plotter Redesign:**
    *   Reworked planner layout with dedicated selection panel and action buttons.
    *   Added explicit per-item actions for copy/delete/edit/reorder/mark.
    *   Added optional EDSM auto-note enrichment for waypoint notes.
*   **Advanced Route Tools:**
    *   Added route health panel (`pending`, `visited`, `missing coords`, `duplicates`).
    *   Added duplicate handling modes: `skip`, `append note`, `keep both`.
    *   Added batch actions for copy/delete/mark done/mark todo.
    *   Added distance inspector (`from current`, `segment`, `cumulative`).
    *   Added import report summaries and CSV route export.
    *   Added Spansh CSV import button and parser support.
*   **Runtime Safety:**

### 🐞 BUG FIXES
*   **Traffic Refresh Reliability:**
    *   Fixed traffic fetch/update logic to refresh dashboard + HUD consistently on system changes.
*   **System Intel Refresh:**
    *   Fixed stale card updates by scheduling panel refreshes from scan/FSS/status event paths.
*   **Star Class Detection:**
    *   Added robust fallbacks so star class is captured from jump/location events and system-star scan events.
*   **UI Performance:**
    *   Added throttled dashboard refresh scheduling to prevent redraw storms during heavy event bursts.

### 🔧 IMPROVEMENTS
*   **Route Planner Defaults:**
    *   Increased default window size to `1020x700` for the expanded control set.
*   **Naming/Clarity:**
    *   Merged duplicate system/star presentation in dashboard cards for cleaner intel display.
*   **Discord Live Output Refresh:**
    *   Removed duplicated navigation/exploration details from the live embed for a cleaner status card.
    *   Limited live embed description to a compact 3-line operations summary.
    *   Moved valuable world reporting to dedicated alert posts instead of the persistent live status message.
    *   Added trend indicators in the live embed (`Progress +N`, `Traffic ↑/↓/→`).
    *   Switched to explicit event-based Discord color mapping (`Jump`, `Scan`, `Valuable`, `Bio`, `FSS`).
